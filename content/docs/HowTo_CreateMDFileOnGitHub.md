# How to Create an .md file on GitHub

## 1. Creating a Repository

* Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"}.
* Click the **+** button in the top-right corner, and then select **New repository**.
* Give it a name, like ``my-doc-test``.
* Leave the repo as **Public** since it's easier for testing.
* Check the box to **Add a README** file.
* Click **Create repository**.

## 2. Adding Markdown Files

* In your new repository, click **Add file** and then **Create new file**.
* Name the file, for example, ``how-to-setup.md``.
* Add some Markdown content. Here’s a quick example:
  
  ```
  # How to Set Up
  This is a test documentation.
  ```
* Click **Commit new file** to save it.

## 3. Viewing the Documentation

* In your repository, just click on the ``.md`` file.
* GitHub will automatically render the Markdown for you — no extra steps needed.

That's it! You've successfully created your first basic Markdown documentation, hosted and readable on GitHub.
